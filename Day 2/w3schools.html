<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3Schools"><b>W3Schools</b></a> is a <u>freemium educational website</u> for learning coding online.[1][2] Initially released in 1998, it derives its name from the World Wide Web but is not affiliated with the W3 Consortium.[3][4] <em>W3Schools offers courses covering many aspects of web development.</em>[5]<mark> W3Schools also publishes free HTML templates. It is run by Refsnes Data in Norway.[6] It has an online text editor called TryIt Editor, and readers can edit examples and run the code in a test environment.</mark>

On the site, source code examples with explanations are shown free of charge in English, most of which can also be edited and executed interactively in a live editor. Other important code elements are hidden so that the user can focus on the code shown (developer sandbox). <b>The tutorials are divided into individual chapters on the development languages</b>. In addition to the basics, application-related implementation options and examples, as well as a focus on individual elements of the programming language (so-called "references") are documented. In addition, there is a YouTube channel, <small>which takes up and explains certain topics in web development, and an Internet forum.</small>
